# Calculator Layout Challenge Solution

These are the things you need in place to achieve this layout:

* All button rows in horizontal stacks (5 in total) - Stack Alignment: Fill, Distribution: Fill Equally, Spacing: 1
* Display Label + 5 Horizontal Stacks in a Vertical Stack - Stack Alignment: Fill, Distribution: Fill Equally, Spacing: 1
* Vertical Stack Pinned to all four edges of superview
* Silver Star if you figured this out: If you want the label to have padding on the left and right, you'll need to embed it in a View and then set 2 pin constraints from the label to the view of 20 each side.
* Gold Star if you figured this out: If you want the 0 button to take up as much space as the . and =, you'll need to embed the . and = in their own horizontal stack with Fill Equally, then embed the 0 and that horizontal stack in a horizontal stack with Fill Equally. This will make the 0 button take up the same space as the other two buttons.
